# Healthcare Multi‑Portal SaaS – Technical Design Document

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document acts as the **single source of truth** for your project implementation. It defines:

* Kubernetes service breakdown
* Database schema & data models
* API grouping & responsibilities
* Entity relationships
* User roles & allowed functions

Once this document is followed, **no architectural confusion or redesign should be needed**.

---

## 2. System Overview (High Level)

The platform is a **public SaaS** with three major portals:

1. Public / Citizen Portal

---

## 11. Kubernetes Namespaces

* public
* govt
* admin
* backend
* monitoring

Namespaces enforce logical isolation between portals.

---

## 12. Kubernetes Deployments (Logical)

Each backend service runs as its own Deployment:

* auth-deployment
* user-deployment
* facility-deployment
* request-deployment
* govt-ops-deployment
* routing-deployment
* metrics-deployment
* audit-deployment

All deployments are stateless and horizontally scalable.

---

## 13. Kubernetes Services

Each Deployment is exposed internally via a ClusterIP Service:

* auth-svc
* user-svc
* facility-svc
* request-svc
* govt-ops-svc
* routing-svc
* metrics-svc
* audit-svc

---

## 14. Ingress Strategy

Single Ingress Controller with path-based routing:

* /api/auth → auth-svc
* /api/users → user-svc
* /api/facilities → facility-svc
* /api/requests → request-svc
* /api/govt → govt-ops-svc
* /api/routes → routing-svc
* /api/metrics → metrics-svc
* /api/audit → audit-svc

This keeps a single public endpoint while preserving service boundaries.

---

## 15. Configuration & Secrets

### ConfigMaps

* Environment configs
* Feature flags
* Region configuration (Dehradun)

### Secrets

* Database credentials
* JWT signing keys
* API keys (maps)

Secrets are never committed to Git.

---

## 16. Scaling & Reliability Rules

* Horizontal Pod Autoscaling enabled for:

  * request-service
  * govt-ops-service
  * routing-service

* Metrics-service scales independently

* Auth-service kept lightweight

---

## 17. Week-1 Execution Guidance

Day 1–2:

* Repo setup
* Kubernetes namespaces
* Auth + User service skeleton

Day 3–4:

* Facility service
* Basic request service

Day 5:

* Ingress + service wiring
* Health checks

---

## 18. Final Note

With this structure:

* You can develop services independently
* You can deploy incrementally
* You can explain every architectural decision clearly

This concludes the infrastructure and execution foundation.

## 19. README.md (Project Root File)

Below is the **complete, production-grade README** you should place in the root of the repository as `README.md`.

```
# Healthcare Multi-Portal SaaS Platform

A **public, multi-cloud, Kubernetes-based healthcare intelligence platform** designed to connect **citizens, clinics, and government health authorities** through a unified, secure, and scalable system.

This project focuses on **visibility, coordination, and cost-aware decision support** rather than clinical systems, making it safe, realistic, and enterprise-aligned.

---

## 🌍 Vision

Healthcare systems often struggle with:
- Poor visibility of nearby clinics and services
- Fragmented government service discovery
- Inefficient field visit planning
- Lack of operational and cost intelligence

This platform bridges the gap between **public users, healthcare facilities, and government authorities** by providing:
- Map-based discovery of verified clinics, hospitals, and blood banks
- Government service request and coordination system
- Route planning for field visits
- Operational and cloud cost savings intelligence for administrators

---

## 🧩 Portals

### 👤 Public Portal
- Discover nearby hospitals, clinics, and blood banks
- Search government health services (e.g., polio vaccination, TB screening)
- Raise service requests with location and contact verification

### 🏛️ Government Portal
- View and manage categorized service requests
- Identify demand clusters on the map
- Plan optimized visit routes using "Easy Mode"
- Close and acknowledge resolved requests

### 🧑‍💼 Admin Portal
- Approve and verify clinic and blood bank registrations
- Monitor platform usage and regional trends
- View cloud and operational savings metrics
- Access system audit logs

---

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

- **Backend:** Microservices (Python / FastAPI)
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **Cloud Strategy:**
  - AWS — Core compute, data, and platform services
  - Azure — Identity and governance services
  - GCP — Maps and AI/analytics services

---

## 🔐 Security & Data Principles

- No patient or medical records are stored
- Only minimal contact data is collected (mobile number & address)
- Role-based access for all system actions
- Requests are never publicly visible
- Facilities must be verified before appearing on the public map
- Immutable audit logs for administrative actions

---

## 🗺️ Key Features

- Interactive healthcare facility map
- Government service discovery and request system
- Blood bank availability visibility
- Request lifecycle management with expiry and archiving
- Route planning for government field teams
- Platform-wide operational and cost metrics

---

## 🧪 Project Status

**Phase:** Platform Skeleton & Infrastructure Setup

Current focus:
- Kubernetes cluster

## 20. Development Roadmap (10 Phases)

### Phase 1: Foundation Fix
- Generate and run Alembic migrations against Postgres
- Fix service startup bugs (missing imports, missing env vars)
- Add CORS middleware to all FastAPI services
- Verify `docker-compose up` boots all 8 services clean

**Deliverable:** All services start, DB tables created, health endpoints reachable.

### Phase 2: Shared Code Consolidation
- Remove duplicated `shared/` folders from each service
- Single `backend/shared/` package mounted or installed across services
- Extract unified auth middleware with role-aware variants
- Standardize error shapes and token parsing

**Deliverable:** One source of truth for models, DB, auth, and utils.

### Phase 3: Auth + User Flow (End-to-End)
- Wire public portal login to real auth-service (OTP request + verify)
- Store tokens properly, wire user-service `/me` to frontend
- Consolidate citizen-portal into public-portal
- Add `.env` with `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` and `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

**Deliverable:** Real user can log in via OTP, see profile, token refresh works.

### Phase 4: Facility Discovery (Public Portal)
- Wire map to facility-service `GET /` endpoint
- Render real facility markers on Mapbox
- Add facility detail view and type filters
- Add blood bank availability feature

**Deliverable:** Citizens see real verified facilities on map with filtering.

### Phase 5: Request Lifecycle (Citizen + Govt)
- Wire request form to request-service `POST /`
- Build "My Requests" page hitting `GET /mine`
- Wire govt dashboard to real summary and map data
- Wire request close action and verify auto-expiry

**Deliverable:** Full request lifecycle — create, view, close, auto-expire.

> **Note:** Phases 4 and 5 can run in parallel.

### Phase 6: Routing + Route Planning
- Wire govt portal route planner to `POST /routes`
- Display optimized route on Mapbox (ordered markers + polyline)
- Show route history and detail views

**Deliverable:** Govt employee generates optimized visit route, views it on map.

### Phase 7: Admin Portal (Real Data)
- Wire verification queue to facility-service pending/verify endpoints
- Wire metrics page to savings, demand, and efficiency endpoints
- Build audit log viewer
- Wire demand clustering recalculation

**Deliverable:** Admin approves facilities, views real metrics, browses audit trail.

### Phase 8: Security Hardening
- Replace hardcoded JWT secret with env-only (fail if missing)
- Add inter-service auth for internal endpoints
- Add rate limiting at gateway level
- Enforce region-restricted visibility and contact validation
- Add HTTPS/TLS configuration

**Deliverable:** No hardcoded secrets, internal APIs protected, rate limits enforced.

### Phase 9: Infrastructure + CI/CD
- Add GitHub Actions pipeline (lint, test, build)
- Add liveness/readiness probes to K8s deployments
- Create missing K8s service manifests
- Stub Terraform for AWS and Azure per multi-cloud design
- Create `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api-contract.md`, `docs/data-model.md`

**Deliverable:** Push-to-deploy pipeline, complete K8s manifests, documentation.

### Phase 10: Polish + Production Readiness
- Add pagination to all list endpoints
- Add error boundaries, loading states, empty states in all portals
- Write seed script for demo data across all roles
- Add HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) configs
- Full integration test across all 3 portals

**Deliverable:** Demo-ready platform matching full design document scope.
